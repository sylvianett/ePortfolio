    <h2>Artifact Overview: SYLTrack (Mobile Application)</h2>
    <p>
      SYLTrack is a mobile application project focused on tracking user weight entries over time. The application supports adding,
      viewing, and managing weight data in a structured way and is designed to support consistency, usability, and maintainability.
      This artifact was originally created earlier in my program and was selected for CS 499 because it demonstrates my ability to
      design and engineer a complete software solution, including thoughtful user interaction, input validation, and organized code structure.

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Why This Artifact Is Included</h2>
    <p>
      I included SYLTrack in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates professional software engineering skills beyond basic functionality.
      It reflects my ability to plan a solution, structure code for maintainability, and improve the application through enhancement work.
      This artifact also aligns with real-world development practices, including iterative improvement, testing/validation, and clear documentation.

    <h2>Artifact Files & Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      I am organizing the SYLTrack artifact files and documentation for publication in my ePortfolio. This section will include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced SYLTrack code files</li>
      <li>Enhancement narrative (Software Design & Engineering)</li>
      <li>Supporting screenshots and/or a short demo overview (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> I will publish the final enhanced files here once the enhancements are finalized and reviewed.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Working on SYLTrack strengthened my understanding of how design decisions impact maintainability and user experience.
      This artifact helped me practice improving an existing codebase by identifying weaknesses, refining structure, and making targeted changes
      that provide clear value. A challenge in this process was balancing usability improvements with keeping the code organized and easy to maintain.
      Overall, enhancing SYLTrack reinforced the importance of thoughtful design, iteration, and clear communication in professional software development.
