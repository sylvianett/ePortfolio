    <h2>Artifact Overview: SYLTrack (Mobile Application)</h2>
    <p>
      SYLTrack is a mobile application designed to help users track weight entries and monitor progress toward goals over time.
      The application supports managing weight data and provides dashboard-style summaries to support user consistency.
      I selected SYLTrack for my CS 499 ePortfolio because it demonstrates real-world software engineering practices such as
      maintainable architecture, multi-screen navigation, and scalable data handling.

    <h2>Why This Artifact Is Included</h2>
    <p>
      I included SYLTrack in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates professional software design and engineering beyond basic functionality.
      This project reflects my ability to analyze an existing codebase, identify weaknesses, and implement enhancements that improve structure,
      usability, and maintainability. The artifact also demonstrates my growth in applying software engineering standards that support long-term
      scalability and user-friendly design.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Architecture + scalability:</strong> improvements focused on a stable and extensible foundation.</li>
      <li><strong>Dashboard development:</strong> implemented a centralized dashboard (SYLBoard) for easier user progress tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Navigation consistency:</strong> added persistent bottom navigation to improve user flow between screens.</li>
      <li><strong>User-based data handling:</strong> ensured weight entries are associated with the authenticated user.</li>
      <li><strong>Goal tracking + summaries:</strong> stored goals persistently and displayed summary progress for recent weight and progress toward goals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="small-note">
      These enhancements reflect professional software engineering practices such as separation of concerns, maintainability, and iterative improvement.

    <h2>Enhancement Summary (Milestone Two)</h2>
    <p>
      For Milestone Two, I prioritized improvements that strengthen the core foundation of the application rather than focusing on visual branding.
      The enhancement work concentrated on navigation consistency, improved data handling, and scalable structure.
      This milestone resulted in a more professional and maintainable application that better represents my software design and engineering skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visual elements (icons, logos, and advanced theming) were intentionally deferred until later milestones to ensure that the underlying structure
      is stable, scalable, and portfolio-ready first.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Enhancing SYLTrack strengthened my understanding of how software design decisions impact maintainability, scalability, and user experience.
      I learned the value of improving structure and navigation first to reduce technical debt and make future enhancements easier.
      One challenge was implementing new usability improvements while keeping the code organized and scalable.
      Overall, this artifact demonstrates growth in software engineering practices and my ability to improve an existing solution through
      thoughtful design and iteration.
