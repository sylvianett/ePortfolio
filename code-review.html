    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This code review documents my evaluation of selected artifacts for my CS 499 ePortfolio and outlines the enhancements I planned
      to strengthen my demonstration of core Computer Science program outcomes. The goal of the review was to identify opportunities
      to improve code quality, algorithmic efficiency, data handling, and overall maintainability. I used the review process to connect
      my prior coursework to professional software practices, including clear documentation, testing, and secure design thinking.

    <h2>Artifacts Reviewed</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SYLTrack (Mobile Application)</strong> – selected to represent Software Design & Engineering and Databases through Android development and data persistence.</li>
      <li><strong>CS 320 Appointment Service</strong> – selected to represent Algorithms & Data Structures through structured test design, validation, and data-driven execution patterns.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Planned Enhancements (Summary)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Software Design & Engineering (SYLTrack):</strong> improve structure, organization, and overall usability; strengthen documentation and maintainability.</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures (CS 320 Appointment Service):</strong> refactor repetitive unit tests into more efficient data-driven/parameterized tests using structured collections.</li>
      <li><strong>Databases (SYLTrack):</strong> strengthen database design and data handling, with clear persistence logic and reliable CRUD behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Code Review Video</h2>
    <p>
      The following video contains my formal code review for CS 499. In the video, I walk through my selected artifacts, explain existing
      functionality, identify improvement areas, and outline the planned enhancements to better demonstrate computer science outcomes.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Completing the code review helped me better understand how to evaluate software as a professional product rather than just a completed assignment.
      It also showed me the importance of communicating clearly about design decisions and enhancements. The review process made it easier to plan realistic,
      measurable improvements that demonstrate growth across categories, especially through cleaner structure, stronger testing strategies, and more reliable
      data management.
